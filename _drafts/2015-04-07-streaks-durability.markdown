As we begin another season of baseball, I'm pondering the topic of streaks.  When I think of baseball streaks, I think of two categories:  durability streaks and performance streaks.  

## Durability Streaks

My first baseball hero was Lou Gehrig.  Although he died forty years before my baseball awakening, I was captivated by Gary Cooper's portrayal of Gehrig in the 1942 movie, "[The Pride of the Yankees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pride_of_the_Yankees)." After replacing Wally Pipp in the Yankees lineup on June 2, 1925, Gehrig played for 2,130 games.  For 14 years Gehrig suited up and played through headaches, colds, aches, back spasms, a broken thumb, and a broken toe.  Batting helmets were not introduced in baseball until 1956 and were not used at all during the 1920's and 1930's.  Gehrig was dropped on more than once by balls to the face and head.  Despite all of his aches and pains, Gehrig put up historic numbers for batting and slugging average.  He earned his nickname, "The Iron Horse" the hard way.  Of course, Cal Ripken extended Gehrig's streak which is also a story of discipline, hardwork, and determination.  Gehrig and Ripkin exemplify "durability streaks." ![Lou Gehrig](/img/lou-Gehrig.jpg)

## Performance Streaks
Joe DiMaggio is the exemplar of a "performance streak." DiMaggio put together what many baseball people say is the feat that will last longer than any other record in baseball-— a 56 game hitting streak.  During this hitting streak he 37 years ago, Pete Rose strung together 44 consecutive games with a hit.  Ten years ago, Jimmy Rollins hit for 38 consecutive games[^1].  What makes a peformance streak?  Stringing together a series of outstanding performances.

There is much speculation on how DiMaggio accomplished such an incredible streak.  How could he sustain such a high peformance for such a long period of time?  Anyone who watches baseball know that hitters are often "robbed" of a hit by an outstanding defensive play.  Did DiMaggio use his above average skill to get the streak or was he lucky during the streak. Edward Beltrami and Jay Mendelsohn[^2] offer two possibilities: 

> The first is that it was a binomial event of extremely low probability but one that actually happened in 1941—something like actually witnessing the occurrence of 100 straight heads in coin tossing. The second is that it is an example of a superior hitter exceeding even his own normal capabilities [^sabr].

Beltrami and Mendelsohn argue the latter— DiMaggio was a top hitter who for a brief time was able to raise his game on a consistent basis.  Whereas Pete Rose hit above his lifetime average during his 1978 streak, DiMaggio hit near his lifetime average during his streak.
