### What is the purpose of this website?

The purpose of this site is to create a container to explore the many facets of life.  I hope that you will find value in the diversity of articles and ideas presented on this website.  It will serve many purposes: 

1) It will be a collection of ideas, insights, and explorations.  
2) It will be the incubator for a variety of projects I am working on.  
3) It will be a place where readers can contribute their voices and find inspiration.  
4)  It will be a website and community that evolves and grows.

### What will be the primary topics of this website?

The website will follow my interests and ideas.  Since I am fascinated by a variety of topics, this will be a generalist website.  I am interested in spirituality, technology, photography, music, education, character formation, habits, ethics, food, gardening, and a host of other topics.

I'm a professional educator, a technology maven, a tinkerer, and a person who is fascinated by the intricacies and complexities of life.
