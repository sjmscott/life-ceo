<h3>What is the purpose of this website?</h3>

<p>The purpose of this site is to create a container to explore the many facets of life.  I hope that you will find value in the diversity of articles and ideas presented on this website.  It will serve many purposes:</p>

<p>1) It will be a collection of ideas, insights, and explorations.<br/>
2) It will be the incubator for a variety of projects I am working on.<br/>
3) It will be a place where readers can contribute their voices and find inspiration.<br/>
4)  It will be a website and community that evolves and grows.</p>

<h3>What will be the primary topics of this website?</h3>

<p>The website will follow my interests and ideas.  Since I am fascinated by a variety of topics, this will be a generalist website.  I am interested in spirituality, technology, photography, music, education, character formation, habits, ethics, food, gardening, and a host of other topics.</p>
