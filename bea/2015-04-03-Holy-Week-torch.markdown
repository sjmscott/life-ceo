Until last year, my Dad went on retreat during Holy Week for as long as I can remember. It was a powerful way for him to immerse himself into the Passion and Death of Jesus in preparation for Easter. This year, he is spending Holy Week at St. Margaret Hall, the Catholic nursing home where he now lives. Suffering from bone cancer and dementia, he is no longer able to walk or live at home with my Mom. He has walked through the whole experience of the last couple of years (spreading cancer, radiation, falling, not being able to walk, etc.) with incredible grace and dignity. He does not complain and stays away from self-pity. I think the hardest thing for him is not being with my Mom all the time. 

Of course, it has also been difficult for Mom. She has to watch her husband of 60 years grow frail and weak. She has to see the love of her life, a vibrant, hard-working, strong man, decline and fade. 

As they've gotten older, their faith in God has grown tremendously. They would pray the rosary together every evening before cocktail hour. They attended daily mass together, my Dad serving at the altar. They were always taking care of other people. So this year, my Mom decided to go on retreat during Holy Week. What a wise thing to do. What a beautiful way to connect with her husband, with whom she cannot connect as she used to. She is there today, praying for Dad, asking God for the strength to be present to Dad even when she is worn out. I can imagine her sitting in the beautiful chapel at the Milford Retreat Center, tears running down her face, feeling sorrow and also gratitude. 

I have always, at least in my adult life, been conscious of how blessed I am to have such faith-filled, humble, dedicated parents. This week only confirms that, and inspires me to imitate them.
