Many people dismiss the humble push up as a vehicle to strength thinking, "if I want to get strong, I need to get to the gym."  Push ups seem too ordinary, too familiar to make a real difference.  The problem isn't with the exercise, but with the consistency and volume.   

Fitness guru Jack LaLanne at age 93 said, "It takes strength to do them, and it takes endurance to do a lot of them. It’s a good indication of what kind of physical condition you’re in."[^jack]

Robert MacDonald, aka Maximus, a modern fitness guru writing for Men's Health says, 

> "For the average  guy, it’s critical to carry your own engine. By that, I mean that you should strive to be strong relative to your size. A good test of your engine is seeing how many consecutive push ups you can do in a row. I work with some of the fittest people in the world, and I think that 50 consecutive perfect push ups is the standard to shoot for— it shows me you can carry your engine.[^max]"

Maximus recommends doing push ups everyday.  He suggests thinking of how many sets you want to complete during the day and make a grid on a piece of paper or on an index card.  Each square represents a set of push ups.  Throughout the day fill in the boxes with the reps you accomplished.  It is far better to less push ups, but make them perfect.  You chest needs to hit the ground every rep and your body needs to be straight.  

McDonald posted an astonishing [workout](https://instagram.com/p/sle1AqFuze/) of 1,296 push-up daily reps.  He tracked his workouts on a 7x7 grid. ![title](/img/pushup-max.png)

His advice is reminiscent of Russian strong man who recommends *Greasing the Groove* by focusing on frequent repetitions of low volume to build up strength.  Instead of trying to break down muscle, you gradually build up strength.

As a kid I remember P.E. teachers urging us to strive for the President's Council fitness award— a goal I never achieved because I was always a few short on pull-ups.  My pull-up count has plunged to zero my push up is a dismal 1 rep.  

The good news is I am inspired and have a plan.  Although I can only do one perfect rep at a time, I can do 20 sets over the course of the day.

So, over the course of the day I will drop to the floor 20 times and crank out 1 perfect push up.  

It seems insignificant, but over the day I will perform 20 perfect push ups. Over the course of the week I will rack up 140.  As I get stronger and the push up is "normalized" I will gradually add more reps.  I will keep this up until I reach my goal of 50 consecutive push ups.  I'm in this for the long haul.  After I nail 50 consecutive push-ups, I might go after 1 pull up.  It would be quite an accomplishment to beyond what I was able to do as a youth.  Maybe I can earn that Presidential Seal of fitness after all of these years.
