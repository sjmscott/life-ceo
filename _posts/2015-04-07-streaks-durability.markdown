As we begin another season of baseball, I'm pondering the topic of streaks.  When I think of baseball streaks, I think of two categories:  durability streaks and performance streaks.

## Durability Streaks

My first baseball hero was Lou Gehrig.  Although he died forty years before my baseball awakening, I was captivated by Gary Cooper's portrayal of Gehrig in the 1942 movie, "[The Pride of the Yankees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pride_of_the_Yankees)." After replacing Wally Pipp in the Yankees lineup on June 2, 1925, Gehrig played for 2,130 games.  For 14 years Gehrig suited up and played through headaches, colds, aches, back spasms, a broken thumb, and a broken toe.  Batting helmets were not introduced in baseball until 1956 and were not used at all during the 1920's and 1930's.  Gehrig was dropped on more than once by balls to the face and head.  Despite all of his aches and pains, Gehrig put up historic numbers for batting and slugging average.  He earned his nickname, "The Iron Horse" the hard way.  Of course, Cal Ripken extended Gehrig's streak which is also a story of discipline, hardwork, and determination.  Gehrig and Ripken exemplify "durability streaks." ![Lou Gehrig](/img/lou-Gehrig.jpg)

## Performance Streaks
Joe DiMaggio is the exemplar of a "performance streak." DiMaggio put together what many baseball people say is the feat that will last longer than any other record in baseball-— a 56 game hitting streak.  During his hitting streak 37 years ago, Pete Rose strung together 44 consecutive games with a hit.  Ten years ago, Jimmy Rollins hit for 38 consecutive games[^1].  What makes a streak of this nature?  Stringing together a series of outstanding performances.

There is much speculation on how DiMaggio accomplished such an incredible streak.  How could he sustain such a high performance for such a long period of time?  Anyone who watches baseball know that hitters are often "robbed" of a hit by an outstanding defensive play.  Did DiMaggio use his above average skill to get the streak or was he lucky during the streak?  Edward Beltrami and Jay Mendelsohn[^2] offer two possibilities: 

> The first is that it was a binomial event of extremely low probability but one that actually happened in 1941—something like actually witnessing the occurrence of 100 straight heads in coin tossing. The second is that it is an example of a superior hitter exceeding even his own normal capabilities [^sabr].

Beltrami and Mendelsohn argue the latter— DiMaggio was a top hitter who for a brief time was able to raise his game on a consistent basis.   Perhaps during the streak DiMaggio had some good fortune when an outfielder was playing too deep and a ball fell for a hit.  However, DiMaggio's streak was not based on luck.  He was a great hitter who strung together 56 games of great hitting.


## What are the lessons of these streaks?

How can we apply this understanding of streaks to our daily lives?  

All of us are capable of durability streaks.  We can honor our commitments by showing up consistently despite our momentary aches, pains, and whims that might pull us in another direction.  We need to be clear on what we want to accomplish and then fight tooth and nail to keep our commitment.  When we make a goal such as "I write 250 words every day" or "I meditate for :20 minutes every day" we must find a way to honor the commitment.

Performance goals are far trickier to put into practice.  Through dedicated practice, focus, and purpose, we will perform at a higher level.  We will raise our game.  Through the study of other pitchers and constant batting practice, DiMaggio opened a door to being a great hitter.  A teacher can dream about stringing together weeks of having a dynamic classroom in which students are eager to learn.  The teacher needs to anticipate the moods of the students, devise innovative lesson plans, and bring positive energy into each class.  However, some days a lesson will crash and burn despite our best intentions.  When we find ourselves in a  DiMaggio-like streak, we need to enjoy the ride.  You don't get into this zone because you are lucky.  You get there because you have prepared and set yourself up with all of the tools and conditions for success.

Embrace the moments when you can't write the lyrics down fast enough or when you are discovering how a particular combination of chords resonates with your heart.  These are moments when it feels like everything is coming together and you have tremendous flow and clarity.  Work hard to keep this going as it will feed you when the writers block or boredom eventually returns.  

When the DiMaggio-like performance streak ends, turn up your Gehrig-like resolution to keep fighting despite the difficulty.
