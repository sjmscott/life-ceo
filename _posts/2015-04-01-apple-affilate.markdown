Have you ever recommended an iphone app to someone? Of course you have!  Most of us technology mavens take great delight in helping someone solve a problem by using our _app de jour_.  Gabe Wetherhead of MacDrifter provides a compelling reason to become an Apple Affiliate:

> Let me start by saying that even if you don't have a blog, you should create an affiliate account and generate affiliate links. You'll make some money back on your purchases you make with it. You will also make a few cents when you share it on Twitter and people buy something with the link. No one gets hurt and you get some motivation to share interesting stuff.

In addition to linking to apps, you can earn commissions by linking to books, music videos, music, movies, and TV shows.  So, how do you get this done?

1. Head over to the [Apple Affiliate Program](https://itunes.phgconsole.performancehorizon.com/login/itunes/en_us)
2. Fill out the brief application
3. Wait to be confirmed as an affiliate.
3. Do what you normally do (recommend, don't push!)
