title: "Why Slack"
---


A friend recently sent an article to me on the skyrocketing valuation of Slack.  When preparting this post, I initially couldn't find the link he had sent. I had to search through evernote, email, and instant messages to find the link he sent.  Douglas Macmillian writing for the Wall Street Journal writes, 

> In an era of soaring valuations for tech startups, Slack has emerged as one of the industry’s most rapidly-appreciating assets a little more than a year after launching its first product. The startup has more than doubled in value since five months ago, when investors valued Slack at $1.12 billion, and now ranks among the world’s most valuable venture-backed developers of software for businesses.

Is this wild valuation another case of a chamagne high? Probably.  Here is the value of Slack:

1) integrations with other software and tools.  
2) email and chat replacement. 
3) one stream that is searchable. All communications in one place rather than scattered throughout email or lost on a chat message.

Slack is a disruptive technlogy that fixes some of the problems of how people communicate with one another.
