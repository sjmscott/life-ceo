My wife and I finally had a moment to ourseleves.  As we walked on the beach in Carmel we spoke about some recent challenges, but more importantly found some space to talk about some bigger life ideas and dreams.  We stopped for a minute to capture the moment with a selfie and our bubble was pierced with a phone call from our son.

His message was actually sweet, uplifting, and comforting— we were quickly able to return to our time together.  However, the interuption helps demonstrates how fleeting moments are.  Smart devices— phones, watches, or whatever else constantly nag us and beckon for our attention.  I have a photographers eye and heart, so I’ll usually think about capturing moments, but I am also keenly aware of how the process of trying to record something can shift a momement.  Fr. Robert Walsh, SJ, a spiritual mentor of mine, once told me, “Watch the sunset! Don’t watch yourself watching the sunset!”   Instead of constantly recording or analyzing moments, we need to grow our ability to become fully engaged in a momement.  This deep presence to a particular moment opens up a greater connection to the peopele we are with, to the world around us, to our authentic self, and perhaps for some, the presence of God or other spiritual truths.  By being fully present to a moment we can delight in and celebrate beauty even while reconginzing that these mindful moments are fleeting.  We need to find pockets of rest, renewal, and beauty knowing that they will be peirced by something else that is calling our attention.
