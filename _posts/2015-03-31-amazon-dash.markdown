Amazon has just released a new way to buy things called [Amazon Dash](https://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-button/).  When you sign up for the program you identify products that you use and your receive a special "Dash Button." You press this button when you want to re-supply your inventory and amazon will begin to process the order.  While this is an interesting concept, it seems unnecessary.  Do people really want to have dash buttons all around the house, office, and yard?  It is already too easy to buy things on Amazon.  The Dash Button feels frivolous and wasteful.  Why not just take out your cell phone and scan the barcode and hit order?  I think the product is ripe for a Saturday Night Live parody.  I can picture a beautiful actress sitting on the toilet frantically pushing the dash button because she has run out of toilet paper only to have the UPS guy walk into the bathroom with a fresh roll of toilet paper. Honestly, if I saw this post on April 1st, I would think this was a good hearted joke.  Do you remember the [Amazon delivery drones](http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011)?  Amazon still claims this is a real product delivery system, but that is a conversation for another post.  

Although I'm giving the Amazon Dash Button a thumbs down, it does bring up an interesting question for Life.ceo readers:  How do you manage your house and office so you don't run out of things?  We will return to this topic in a future post.
