				<p>As discussed in the post on <a href="/productivity/2015/04/07/streaks-durability/">Learning from Gehrig and DiMaggio</a>, there are at least two different types of streaks— durabilty and performance streaks.  What should you do when a streak ends?</p>

<p>I’ve been tracking streaks at the website <a href="https://www.coach.me/dashboard">Coach.me</a>.  Coach.me began as a website called lift and has recently changed their name to emphasize 1-1 coaching.  It is a good system for tracking durability streaks, but the website lacks some vital elements for performance tracking.</p>

<p>I recently had a durability streak of 181 days of practicing the guitar.  For 181 days I carried my guitar on vacation, practiced when I was busy, tired, and sick.  However, on what would have been day 183, I realized that I forgot to practice the day before.</p>

<p>Here are some tips on how to handle the end of a streak.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be Honest</strong>— I have to admit that I was tempted to tick the box and let it slide.  For a few minutes, I allowed myself to rationalize the situation– I had thought about playing and had even looked at a guitar book.  Deceiving yourself or others does nothing to get your closer to your goal.  When a streak ends or you break a commitment to yourself, use it as an opportunity to grow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Why did the streak end?</strong>- Did you forget?  Did you intentionally stop the streak?  If so, was it because you were lazy or didn’t care?  Were you sick or overburdened?   Did you get lazy?  Do you still care about your goal?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What did you do well?</strong>— Take some time to pat yourself on the back!  Many people won’t even attempt to work on a goal, especially a personal or enrichment goal.  Or, they won’t bother to track progress on a goal because it is a nuisance or they will be confronted with the reality that they really aren’t making progress.  Celebrate your awesome achievement and know that you can begin a new streak.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tighten your Focus</strong>— If this is a goal that you care about, how can you improve your focus?  Do you need to create a reminder?  Do you need to schedule the activity?  Do you need to let go of less important goals to make room for your deeper goal?  Don’t just take a white knuckle approach and say, “I’ll try harder!” Take the time to plot out a strategy to succeed.  Be specific.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Look for Support</strong>- Do you have any friends that are pursuing the same goal?  Do you belong to an online community that can help you with your goal? Are there any tools that you can help you in your pursuit?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Look for Micro Movements that lead to success</strong>- As silly as it sounds, the number one factor for me being successful on my 181 day streak was putting my guitar on a stand in my bedroom.  What are the small, micro movements that lead to success?  Perhaps it is putting your running shorts at the foot of your bed or putting the dog’s leash by the front door.  Every streak has small movements which help remind, motivate, or inspire you to continue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Don’t get down on yourself</strong>- Getting down on yourself has no productive value.  Instead, focus on what you can learn and how you can grow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Start Again</strong>- With new tools, insights, and inspiration, begin again.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
