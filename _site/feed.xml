        <title>Learning from Gehrig and DiMaggio</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As we begin another season of baseball, I’m pondering the topic of streaks.  When I think of baseball streaks, I think of two categories:  durability streaks and performance streaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;durability-streaks&quot;&gt;Durability Streaks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first baseball hero was Lou Gehrig.  Although he died forty years before my baseball awakening, I was captivated by Gary Cooper’s portrayal of Gehrig in the 1942 movie, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pride_of_the_Yankees&quot;&gt;The Pride of the Yankees&lt;/a&gt;.” After replacing Wally Pipp in the Yankees lineup on June 2, 1925, Gehrig played for 2,130 games.  For 14 years Gehrig suited up and played through headaches, colds, aches, back spasms, a broken thumb, and a broken toe.  Batting helmets were not introduced in baseball until 1956 and were not used at all during the 1920’s and 1930’s.  Gehrig was dropped on more than once by balls to the face and head.  Despite all of his aches and pains, Gehrig put up historic numbers for batting and slugging average.  He earned his nickname, “The Iron Horse” the hard way.  Of course, Cal Ripken extended Gehrig’s streak which is also a story of discipline, hardwork, and determination.  Gehrig and Ripken exemplify “durability streaks.” &lt;img src=&quot;/img/lou-Gehrig.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lou Gehrig&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;performance-streaks&quot;&gt;Performance Streaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe DiMaggio is the exemplar of a “performance streak.” DiMaggio put together what many baseball people say is the feat that will last longer than any other record in baseball-— a 56 game hitting streak.  During his hitting streak 37 years ago, Pete Rose strung together 44 consecutive games with a hit.  Ten years ago, Jimmy Rollins hit for 38 consecutive games&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  What makes a streak of this nature?  Stringing together a series of outstanding performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/joe_dimaggio_hitting.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Joe DiMaggio&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much speculation on how DiMaggio accomplished such an incredible streak.  How could he sustain such a high performance for such a long period of time?  Anyone who watches baseball know that hitters are often “robbed” of a hit by an outstanding defensive play.  Did DiMaggio use his above average skill to get the streak or was he lucky during the streak?  Edward Beltrami and Jay Mendelsohn&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; offer two possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first is that it was a binomial event of extremely low probability but one that actually happened in 1941—something like actually witnessing the occurrence of 100 straight heads in coin tossing. The second is that it is an example of a superior hitter exceeding even his own normal capabilities &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:sabr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:sabr&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beltrami and Mendelsohn argue the latter— DiMaggio was a top hitter who for a brief time was able to raise his game on a consistent basis.   Perhaps during the streak DiMaggio had some good fortune when an outfielder was playing too deep and a ball fell for a hit.  However, DiMaggio’s streak was not based on luck.  He was a great hitter who strung together 56 games of great hitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-the-lessons-of-these-streaks&quot;&gt;What are the lessons of these streaks?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we apply this understanding of streaks to our daily lives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of us are capable of durability streaks.  We can honor our commitments by showing up consistently despite our momentary aches, pains, and whims that might pull us in another direction.  We need to be clear on what we want to accomplish and then fight tooth and nail to keep our commitment.  When we make a goal such as “I write 250 words every day” or “I meditate for :20 minutes every day” we must find a way to honor the commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance goals are far trickier to put into practice.  Through dedicated practice, focus, and purpose, we will perform at a higher level.  We will raise our game.  Through the study of other pitchers and constant batting practice, DiMaggio opened a door to being a great hitter.  A teacher can dream about stringing together weeks of having a dynamic classroom in which students are eager to learn.  The teacher needs to anticipate the moods of the students, devise innovative lesson plans, and bring positive energy into each class.  However, some days a lesson will crash and burn despite our best intentions.  When we find ourselves in a  DiMaggio-like streak, we need to enjoy the ride.  You don’t get into this zone because you are lucky.  You get there because you have prepared and set yourself up with all of the tools and conditions for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embrace the moments when you can’t write the lyrics down fast enough or when you are discovering how a particular combination of chords resonates with your heart.  These are moments when it feels like everything is coming together and you have tremendous flow and clarity.  Work hard to keep this going as it will feed you when the writers block or boredom eventually returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the DiMaggio-like performance streak ends, turn up your Gehrig-like resolution to keep fighting despite the difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This was spread out over two seasons.  Rollins ended the 2005 season with two hits and started the 2006 season with 34 hits. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Edward Beltrami is professor emeritus at Stony Brook University and Jay Mendelsohn is a retired associate professor of computer science at Hofstra University. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Passwords: Simple or Complex</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/password2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Password&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week there was a bit of an uproar over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tdcanadatrust.com/products-services/banking/index-banking.jsp&quot;&gt;TD Canada Trust&lt;/a&gt; who disabled the ability for its users to copy/paste passwords into their iOS app.  The controversy got into full swing when in response to a customer question, TD Canada Trust posted this on twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”. . . your password should be committed to memory rather than using a password mgr” –&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/roustem/status/578909191533944832&quot;&gt;via Twitter&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AgileBits, the makers of the awesome &lt;strong&gt;1Password&lt;/strong&gt; app wrote a fantastic open letter which included the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Using long, random, and unique passwords is the best defense that we, your users, have against attackers. This advice is true for every site we have to sign in to these days … and believe me, we sign in to a lot more than just our financial sites. Keeping 100 or so strong and unique passwords memorized is not only a silly suggestion, it’s nearly impossible for all but the most savant-ish of us. Password managers help us increase our security by remembering these unique passwords for us, keeping them stored securely, and filling them in on websites so we don’t have to. - Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.agilebits.com/2015/03/23/an-open-letter-to-banks/&quot;&gt;1Password Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, TD Canada Trust relented and re-enabled copy/paste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a choice between a simple memorized password that is typically used at multiple sites or a complex password that is unique at every website, I’ll recommend the password manager &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/password.png&quot; alt=&quot;Password&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fantastical 2 Review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fantastical2-mac-screenshot-dark.png&quot; alt=&quot;fantastical&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a long-time user of the Fantastical Menu Bar app and Fantastical for the iPhone.  It always provided a quick scan of the day and helped me to check to see the next upcoming appointment.  If you are unfamiliar with Fantastical for the iPhone, check out Steve Owen’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-calendar-app-iphone/&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; over at the Sweet Setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.busymac.com/busycal/&quot;&gt;BusyCal&lt;/a&gt;– until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantastical 2 has just changed the osx calendar app field with a beautiful application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of the features that make this worth purchasing or at least giving it a shot with the 14 day demo which you can download &lt;a href=&quot;http://flexibits.com/fantastical&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use natural lanugage such as &lt;strong&gt;take car to shop at 1pm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fantastical 2 has sweated every pixel to create a beautiful and clear design. Federico Viticci writes: “Its information-rich display is based on a rigorous attention to visual cues and Flexibits have outdone themselves in translating the iOS experience to navigation that feels at home on OS X.”– &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macstories.net/reviews/fantastical-2-for-mac-review-reinvented/&quot;&gt;MacStories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Calendar Sets” which help you to organize your calendars.  You can create a calendar set for home, one for work, and one for seeing family events.  Instead of toggling individual calendars on or off, you can quick jump to the set for the proper context. Even better, using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence&quot;&gt;geofencing&lt;/a&gt; you can automatically switch calendars based on your location.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fantastical 2 improves on the “Mini Window” which enables you to quickly scan through your appointments without opening the app.  You can now pull the window away from the menu bar and have it float wherever you want.  This is helpful when you are trying to consult your calendar while working in another app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;

        <title>Become an Apple Affiliate</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever recommended an iphone app to someone? Of course you have!  Most of us technology mavens take great delight in helping someone solve a problem by using our &lt;em&gt;app de jour&lt;/em&gt;.  Gabe Wetherhead of MacDrifter provides a compelling reason to become an Apple Affiliate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying that even if you don’t have a blog, you should create an affiliate account and generate affiliate links. You’ll make some money back on your purchases you make with it. You will also make a few cents when you share it on Twitter and people buy something with the link. No one gets hurt and you get some motivation to share interesting stuff.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macdrifter.com/2015/03/blink-for-ios.html&quot;&gt;via Macdrifter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to linking to apps, you can earn commissions by linking to books, music videos, music, movies, and TV shows.  So, how do you get this done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Head over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.phgconsole.performancehorizon.com/login/itunes/en_us&quot;&gt;Apple Affiliate Program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fill out the brief application&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wait to be confirmed as an affiliate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do what you normally do (recommend, don’t push!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Won&#39;t Press Amazon Dash Button</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon has just released a new way to buy things called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-button/&quot;&gt;Amazon Dash&lt;/a&gt;.  When you sign up for the program you identify products that you use and your receive a special “Dash Button.” You press this button when you want to re-supply your inventory and amazon will begin to process the order.  While this is an interesting concept, it seems unnecessary.  Do people really want to have dash buttons all around the house, office, and yard?  It is already too easy to buy things on Amazon.  The Dash Button feels frivolous and wasteful.  Why not just take out your cell phone and scan the barcode and hit order?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the product is ripe for a Saturday Night Live parody.  I can picture a beautiful actress sitting on the toilet frantically pushing the dash button because she has run out of toilet paper only to have the UPS guy walk into the bathroom with a fresh roll of toilet paper. Honestly, if I saw this post on April 1st, I would think this was a good hearted joke.  Do you remember the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011&quot;&gt;Amazon delivery drones&lt;/a&gt;?  Amazon still claims this is a real product delivery system, but that is a conversation for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is Slack worth it?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend recently sent me information on the skyrocketing valuation of Slack.  As I began to prepare this post, I realized that I didn’t know exactly where to find the information. Was it a link on text messages?  Was it sent via evernote or a direct message on twitter?  Was it sent as a PDF through email?  Slack tries to solve the problem of communication fragmentation.  Slack seeks to “be a platform for team communication: everything in one place, instantly searchable, available wherever you go.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:slack2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:slack2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;”  Essentially, Slack seeks to replace text messages, emails, alerts, and notifications create a singular funnel of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;image-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/slack-why.png&quot; alt=&quot;Slack&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Douglas Macmillian, writing for the Wall Street Journal blog on March 26, 2015, writes about the phenomenal growth and valuation of slack.  He writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In an era of soaring valuations for tech startups, Slack has emerged as one of the industry’s most rapidly-appreciating assets a little more than a year after launching its first product. The startup has more than doubled in value since five months ago, when investors valued Slack at $1.12 billion, and now ranks among the world’s most valuable venture-backed developers of software for businesses. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:slack&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:slack&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this wild valuation another case of a champagne high? Probably.  Although this is an important and interesting question, I’d like to focus on whether this app is worthwhile.  Regardless of the speculative value of the company, I think that Slack platform has enormous benefits and offers the potential to solve many problems.  To summarize, here are few of the key benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Slack has a myriad of integrations with other software and tools.  There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/integrations&quot;&gt;official integrations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.slack.com/community&quot;&gt;unofficial integrations&lt;/a&gt; that are built by the rapidly growing community. These integrations help pull information from a variety of services into the Slack ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Email was once cool, but it is now a burden.  Instead of hundreds of people sending a hodgepodge of unfiltered and unsorted email into one account, Slack enables users to create channels to corral conversations into discreet containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) All of the conversations and information are archived and can be searched.  It saves you the trouble of trying to figure out where you put that link or article that a colleague or friend sent to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/slack-integrations.png&quot; alt=&quot;Slack&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Slack works on just about every modern device and operating system.  If you want to use Slack on the road, you will have to retire your Palm Pilot or flip phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is something enticing about using a clean and well designed platform.  We will have to wait to see if Slack helps make sense of the digital explosions in our lives or if it gets tossed aside in the digital dustbin.  For me, the bottom line is that Slack fixes some of the problems of how people communicate with one another. For now, I’m going to use Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
